# This is the collection of all the assignments for CPE 321 at Cal Poly

## Historic Crypto
This folder contains files that decrypt: Caesar Cipher, Monoalphabetic Cipher, Vigenere Cipher.
They each have their own script in _src/_ and files to decrypt in _data/_

To run them run the file along with the file to decrypt in the commandline.

## Block Ciphers
Each task has its own file, you just need to run them and provide the files you want to encrypt
in the command line. All the outputs go into _outputs/_

Task2 just needs to be run, the code can be checked to make sure its doing the right thing.
