1. For task 1, how hard would it be for an adversary to solve the Diffie Hellman 
    Problem (DHP) given these parameters? What strategy might the adversary 
    take?

    It shouldn't be too hard as you know A, B, p, and g. All you would really need to
    do is solve for Alice and Bob's a and b. This would require using the Extended Euclidean 
    algorithm to solve for x = g^b. It gets harder to crack with larger numbers,
    however once you find a or b, it should be simple to solve for s the same way Alice and 
    Bob had.

2. For task 1, would the same strategy used for the tiny parameters work for the 
    p and g? Why or why not?

    It could, but not nearly as easily as with smaller numbers. Much larger numbers would require
    much more computation to reverse engineer.

3. For task 2, why were these attacks possible? What is necessary to prevent it?

    These tasks are possible because the MITM (Mallory) is able to snoop on the traffic between
    Alice and Bob. The data they are using to generate a "secret" key to communicate through
    is in plaintext. As long as Mallory knows what protocol they are attempting to use, she can
    intervene and pose as both Alice and Bob.

    In order to prevent this from happening, Alice and Bob would need to share the necessary information
    using another secret key that they ideally only them and nobody else knows.

4. For task 3 part 1, while itâ€™s very common for many people to use the same 
    value for e in their key (common values are 3, 7, 216+1), it is very bad if two 
    people use the same RSA modulus n. Briefly describe why this is, and what 
    the ramifications are.
